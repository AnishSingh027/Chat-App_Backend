## Important notes

#### _Why it is recommended Always use HttpOnly, Secure while setting cookies?_

**Each of these options protects against specific, serious security vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF.**

- **HttpOnly: Protection from XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**
- Prevents JavaScript from accessing your cookie. If a hacker injects malicious JavaScript into your site (XSS), they wonâ€™t be able to steal your cookie via document.cookie.

- **Secure: Protection from packet sniffing**
- Only sends the cookie over HTTPS, not HTTP.ithout secure: true, the cookie can be sent over unencrypted HTTP, which exposes it to attackers on the network (like public Wi-Fi sniffing).

ðŸ”’ Always use HTTPS in production.
